# Machine learning and data assimilation with the Lorenz '96 system

This repository contains code for investigating machine learning and data assimilation with the Lorenz '96 system, a toy weather model, inspired by [Dueben and Bauer](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-3999-2018).

## Repository structure

- `ai` contains scripts for training a neural net to emulate the Lorenz '96 system.
- `assimilation` contains scripts for running data assimilation with the numerical model and the trained model.
- `forecast` contains scripts for comparing "weather forecasts" run with the numerical model and the trained model.
- `numerical_model` contains FORTRAN90 code for running the numerical model. This is compiled with f2py so it can be called from Python.

## Dependencies
- numpy
- keras

## Installation

Simply run `source setup.sh` from the root directory. This will build the numerical model and add it to the Python path.
